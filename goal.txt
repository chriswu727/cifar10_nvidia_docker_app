Introduction
I will build a deep learning web application that trains and serves a CIFAR-10 model using deep learning 
and computer vision techniques. The model will be packaged in an Nvidia Docker container for deployment. 
The application will have a frontend UI, a backend API, a message broker for task queuing, 
a reverse proxy for routing, a database for user data, and object storage for managing datasets 
and model artifacts.
System Architecture
1. User Interface (Frontend)(needs coding)
Purpose: Allows users to upload images, submit training requests, and view results.
Stack: React.js or Vue.js (for an interactive UI)
API Calls: Communicates with the backend via REST/GraphQL endpoints.

2. Backend (FastAPI)(needs coding)
Purpose: Handles user requests, trains the CIFAR-10 model, and serves predictions.
Stack: FastAPI (for high-performance Python web services)
Components:
Training Endpoint: Triggers model training.
Inference Endpoint: Runs inference on uploaded images.
Database Interaction: Stores job metadata and user submissions.
Task Queue: Sends long-running tasks (training/inference) to Celery workers.

3. Model Training & Inference (Nvidia Docker)
Purpose: Runs CIFAR-10 training and inference inside a container.
Stack:
Nvidia Docker: Runs deep learning workloads with GPU acceleration.
PyTorch/TensorFlow: Model training.
Docker SDK: Manages containerized training and inference jobs.
boto3: Stores trained models in MinIO.

4. Message Queue (RabbitMQ + Celery)(needs coding)
Purpose: Decouples request handling from model processing.
Stack:
RabbitMQ: Message broker to manage job queues.
Celery: Distributed task queue for running training and inference jobs.
Flower: Monitors Celery task execution.

5. Database (PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy)
Purpose: Stores user submissions, model metadata, and request logs.
Stack:
PostgreSQL: Main relational database.
SQLAlchemy + Alembic: ORM and database migrations.
pgAdmin: Database management UI.

6. Object Storage (MinIO)
Purpose: Stores datasets, trained models, and inference results.
Stack:
MinIO: S3-compatible object storage.
boto3: Interacts with MinIO from Python.

7. Reverse Proxy (Nginx)(needs coding)
Purpose: Routes frontend and API requests to appropriate services.
Stack:
Nginx: Load balancing and reverse proxying.

8. Logging & Monitoring
Purpose: Tracks app behavior and detects failures.
Stack:
structlog: Structured logging for backend services.
Sentry SDK: Monitors and captures application errors.

Workflow
User Uploads Image / Requests Model Training
Frontend sends request to FastAPI backend.
Backend stores request details in PostgreSQL.
Backend sends task to RabbitMQ.
Celery Worker Processes Request
If it's a training job, it runs inside the Nvidia Docker container.
If it's an inference job, it loads the trained model and returns results.
Results are stored in PostgreSQL and MinIO.
User Retrieves Results
Frontend polls the API to fetch results from PostgreSQL / MinIO.
Nginx routes requests accordingly.
